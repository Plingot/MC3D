MC3D (MartianCraft 3D) is a set of platform-agnostic C types and functions for use with creating 3D graphics using OpenGL and OpenGL ES. They have been used in production code on both iOS and Android applications and have been coded to need as little tweaking or modification. MC3D does not use any hardware-specific features, such as NEON, or ARM assembly, though on iOS, certain functions, such as matrix multiplication, will leverage the Accelerate framework, but there are also platform independent versions of these functions that function identically, just without the benefit of vector acceleration. 

Documentation is sparse, and this library is very much a work in progress. Functions and types implementing higher-level objects, such as full 3D models, bones and skeletons for animation, and full scenes, are in progress, but not ready for release.
